# Module 9 Challenge

## Project description 

This analysis was done to study temperatures in Hawaii at different times of the year. June and December were chosen as the months to focus the analysis on, because they are 6 months apart. 
Weather data from 9 different stations were used to study the weather patterns in Oahu, Hawaii, to see if  setting up a surf and ice cream shop would be reasonable. 
 
## Results
- The June and December dataframes have a few differences. First, there were about 10 more counts in December compared to June, so there is slightly more data.

- June, as expected, has a higher mean temperature than December (77.2 vs 71.1).

- December had a higher standard deviation in temperature.
